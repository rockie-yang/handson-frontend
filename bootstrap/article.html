                            I’m extremely excited for my upcoming trip to Iceland later this year! At least that’s what I had wished for… My parents have been telling my sister and I for the longest time that our next vacation destination would be Iceland but then we went to Europe instead, and then Africa, and then Rio, and the list goes on. I’m not saying by any means that I’m ungrateful but if there’s one thing that I would like to experience beyond a safari or carnival in Rio are the northern lights. Every since watching Brother Bear back in the day (2003 to be exact) as a child, it has been a dream of mine to see the northern lights in person. The animated Disney movie was the first to introduce me to this spectacle. Just from an animated movie alone, I fell in love with the idea of the northern lights. I asked my parents if those “pretty” lights existed and to a 7 year old, imagine my excitement when they said they were! Ever sine then I have wanted to go see the lights every vacation opportunity, even if it meant if I would spend the majority of my time in a parka, gloves, and boots. I mean you can tan anywhere and anytime but you can’t see the northern lights just anywhere–the sun could wait.
